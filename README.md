## <a name="Intro"></a>Intro

<p>This is my 3rd game made by Unity. I wanted to remake my 1st game that was based on zombies, but had all sorts of errors, shortcomings and etc.<br>
Your goal in this game is to survive as long as you can via eliminating zombies and buying various items from the in-game shop.<br><br>
For this, you have two weapons:
  <ul>
    <li>a pistol</li>
    <li>an assault rifle with flashlight equiped</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## <a name="Features"></a>Features

<ul>
 <li><b>Great graphics:</b> this project was done via HDRP(High Definition Render Pipeline).</li>
  <li><b>Exploration:</b> this is not a small map by any means, so you could take some time to explore it and feel it!</li>
  <li><b>Sound:</b> this game has both UI, environment, enemy and player sounds and more!</li>
  <li><b>Particle effects:</b> this game features some particle systems, like vent smoke, weapon fire or fog.</li>
  <li><b>Animations:</b> both the player and zombies have animations, e.g attacking, running, reloading a weapon.</li>
  <li><b>Multiple Scenes:</b> game features few scenes, from the main scene, to main menu, pause menu or a game over menu</li>
  <li><b>Round System:</b> The Living Dead core mechanic is rounds: every round you get a random amount of zombies and you must kill them to proceed to a next round.</li>
 <li><b>Shop System:</b> You can buy various items, from ammo to utilities that will help you to survive!</li>
</ul>

## <a name="RoundSystem"></a>Round System
<p>Before every round, the round system generates a random number between increasing min and max ranges.<br>
That number is going to be total zombies that will spawn for that particular round.<br><br>
E.g for round number 1, you can expect between 5 and 10 zombies.<br>
    for round number 10, you can expect between 23 and 55 zombies.
